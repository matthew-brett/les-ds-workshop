# Handout

https://github.com/matthew-brett/data-science-discussions/blob/master/berkeley-talk/data_science_as_culture_handout.pdf

# An orientation

An answer to "What is data science?" through "How would we recognize data
science?"

# A definition and a warning

> The now-contemplated field of Data Science amounts to a superset of the
> fields of statistics and machine learning which adds some technology for
> ‘scaling up’ to ‘big data’. This chosen superset is motivated by commercial
> rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to
> miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next fifty years.

# The data scientist in industry

# Koan 1

What would a degree programme, division or institute of "research science"
look like?

How would it differ from a programme in "data science"?

# The data scientist in industry

> ... what data scientists do is make discoveries while swimming in data ...
> At ease in the digital realm, they are able to bring structure to large
> quantities of formless data and make analysis possible. ... Data scientists’
> most basic, universal skill is the ability to write code.

Jeff Hammerbacher quoted in [@loukides2010what_is]

# Koan 2

Data scientist is an industry term, but data scientists largely came from the
empirical sciences.

How did that happen?

What should we teach?

[@tukey1962future]

# Attitudes

> Almost all the most vital attitudes can be described in a type form:
> willingness to face up to *X*.

where *X* includes:

* more realistic problems,
* the necessarily approximate nature of useful results in data analysis,
* the need for collecting the results of actual experience with specific
  data-analytic techniques,
* the need for iterative procedures,
* free use of ad hoc and informal procedures, and
* the fact that data analysis is intrinsically an empirical science.

# Tukey and data science

* Fire Control Research Office
* Bell Labs
* The Kinsey Report (Cochran, Mosteller and Tukey, 1953, 1954);
* Panel on Seismic Improvement (Tukey, 1959);
* Environmental pollution (Tukey et al., 1965; Tukey, 1966);

# Leo Breiman and culture in statistics

Two cultures - "data modeling" and "algorithmic modeling"

> a\) Focus on finding a good solution - that's what consultants get paid
> for.
\hfill\break
> b\) Live with the data before you plunge into modeling.
\hfill\break
> c\) Search for a model that gives a good solution, either algorithmic or
> data.
\hfill\break
> d\) Predictive accuracy on test sets is the criterion for how good the model
> is.
\hfill\break
> e\) Computers are an indispensable partner
\hfill\break

# Koan 3

Is Tukey a data scientist?

Is Breiman?

Is Chambers?

# Koan 3

Why now?

# Why now?

* Rise of computing.
* Programming languages;
* Tools;
* Process.

# Returning to the mysteries

* "Data scientists mostly do arithmetic and that's a good thing"
* Tools and Software, Reproducibility and Open Science.

# Data science as analysis culture

What does this mean for the relationship between data science and:

* big data;
* machine learning;
* artificial intelligence;
* statistics;
* computer science;
* open-source computing;
* reproducibility;
* getting a job as a "data scientist"?

# What does this mean for

* Undergraduate teaching?
* Graduate teaching?
* Research process?

# Teaching and research process
